As a first project deliverable of metis, we have been asked for working on the New York City MTA Turnstile data. 
So, for the purpose of this project we have used Pandas, MatplotLib, seaborn and pickle to support the exploratory data analysis process and to come up with a visualization of our results.

##Problem statement:
WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) has a street teams that start working on every summer targeting the most contributions to thier annual OMGYN Gala. In order to optimize thier team, they are trying to deploy thier street teams in different NYC subway stations. The street teams will collect email addresses and those who sign up are sent free tickets to the gala.
Our job is to analyze the MTA data set and give recommendations on which subway stations to deploy their street teams for maximum signatures.
