From the above chart we can see there is about 20% of the bank customers leaving the bank and about 80% of them still customers of the bank. However, as part of the bank's marketing plan, these customers should be dealt with them in a proper way to minimize bank exits. The objective of this project is to develop a churn model that predicts customers exits.
